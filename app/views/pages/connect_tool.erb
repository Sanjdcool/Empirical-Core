      <p class='description'>
        Help your students advance from fragmented and run-on sentences to complex and well-structured sentences with Quill Connect. Using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining, students combine multiple ideas into a single sentence. They then receive instant feedback designed to help them improve the clarity and precision of their sentences.
