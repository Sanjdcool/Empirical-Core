The Boston Port Act declared that Boston Harbor would remain closed until the colonists paid for the tea that had been destroyed. No ships were allowed to enter or leave without British permission.<br /><br />The Massachusetts Government Act declared that the people of the colony were now under stricter control in terms of meetings and electing their own officials. From that point on, the British king and his ministers would make all decisions about which colonists would serve in important positions in Massachusetts.<br /><br />The Administration of Justice Act made new rules for trials. Bostonians accused of a crime would no longer be tried in Boston by fellow Bostonians. Instead, they would be sent either to another colony, such as Canada, or even to London. They would also be tried in a special Admiralty court by a judge handpicked by the king.<br /><br />The Quartering Act declared that the colonists had to provide quarters, or temporary places to live, for the British soldiers stationed in the colonies. The colonists also had to provide supplies such as food, bedding, candles, and firewood.

It developed along the Indus River on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The civilization was well-known for sophisticated cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro that included a grid street pattern and drainage systems. The Indus Civilization may have had a population of over five million. Over 2500 cities and settlements have been found. Around the middle of the second millennium B.C.E., the Indus River basin dried up, and the sites were abandoned.<br><br><strong>Vedic Civilization and Hinduism (1500 BCE- 320 BCE)</strong><br>After the fall of the Indus River Valley civilization, new settlements called the Vedic Civilization took root in India. Some scholars believe that the people who founded these civilizations migrated into India from the northwest. Several small kingdoms and tribes, which were often at war with each other, merged to form a few large ones.<br><br>The belief system that dominates India today, Hinduism, developed at this time. The most important texts of Hinduism including the Vedas and the Mahabharata (a part of which is called the Bhagavad Gita) were written down during the Vedic Period after being passed down orally through generations.<br><br><strong>The Mahajanapadas</strong><br>The Mahajanapadas were the sixteen most powerful kingdoms and republics of the era, located mainly across the fertile Ganges River plains, however there were a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of India that also existed during the late Vedic period. These kingdoms existed until the Maurya Empire unified much of India in 320 BCE.<br><br><strong>Buddhism</strong><br>In 537 B.C.E., another major belief system, named Buddhism, was founded by a prince named Siddhartha Gautama (later known as &ldquo;Buddha&rdquo;) in India. Buddhism is related to Hinduism but rejects many of Hinduism&rsquo;s most important beliefs. Buddhism was embraced by the Maurya Empire and spread throughout Asia. &nbsp;<br><br>Source: Adapted from &ldquo;India.&rdquo; New World Encyclopedia. <a href='http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/India'>http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/India</a></p><br/><br/>"},"teach":{"script":[{"data":{"body":"<p><strong>Say: </strong>Today you’re going to learn about time order words.
