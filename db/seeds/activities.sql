The men chosen for the\n  mission were {+Pavel Belyayev-pavel belyayev|43} and {+Alexey Leonov.-alexey leonov.|43}\n  Leonov was to perform the EVA, while Belyayev was to pilot the vessel. The rocket\n  they were using was a new type called a Voskhod{+rocket, that-rocket, which|110}\n  had an inflatable airlock built-in.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe {+airlock, which-airlock, that|108}\n  Soviet scientists had only completed nine months prior, functioned perfectly during\n  the mission. {+However,-However|173} the {+cosmonauts'-cosmonauts|166} suits did\n  not work {+quite-quiet|223} as well.

By just 10 minutes into the {+spacewalk,-spacewalk|239}\n  Leonov noticed his suit had became so swollen that he was unable to reach the lock\n  where the door handle was.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLeonov knew he had to act fast, so he decided\n  to make a risky move. He opened up a pressure valve in his suit to try to bleed\n  off some of the excess pressure. Despite the danger of the maneuver, Leonov managed\n  to release enough pressure {+that-where|110} he was able to safely re-enter the\n  rocket.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOnce Leonov was back inside the craft, the two cosmonauts {+then-than|207}\n  worked {+quickly-quick|86} to prepare their ship to return to earth. What the men\n  did not anticipate was how difficult it would be to maneuver {+themselves-himself|69}\n  inside the rocket while wearing {+their-there|212} bulky spacesuits. As a result,\n  they took an additional 46 seconds to get the {+ship's-ships|165} center of gravity\n  into the correct position to re-enter earth's atmosphere. The delay caused the ship\n  to fly off course, and the two men landed in the inhospitable Soviet tundra.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen\n  the craft landed, the forest cover was so dense that the {+Soviets-Soviet's|228}\n  could not land helicopters in the area. The two cosmonauts had to spend the night\n  out in the forest in -45C weather. The next morning, the two {+cosmonauts-Cosmonauts|10}\n  awoke to a Soviet search and rescue squad, who transported them back to base. Despite\n  the problems that arose during the mission, as well as the risky solutions the men\n  were forced to employ, both Leonov and Belyayev survived the ordeal. As a result,\n  both men became national heroes who are still celebrated to this day. \\"\n", "instructions"=>"--- Carefully read the story below, making any corrections you feel might be appropriate.\n...\n"	1	64	2014-01-08 21:07:48.41956	2016-09-23 18:38:55.825361	{production}	t	\N	\N

Their first musical gigs were at school dances in middle school and {+then-than|272} high school. They got their record label when they were overheard recording a song they had written called “Hey Schoolgirl.” Next, they were next given a spot on {+an-a|3024} old television show called “American Bandstand,” which was a music performance show for children. \r\n\r\nWhile the duo’s music received fame by itself, their music is also famous for the soundtrack of the hit 1960’s movie “The Graduate.” The director of the film, Mike Nichols, became obsessed with their music and ask them to help with the soundtrack. This is how the {+duo’s-duos|501} song “Ms. Robinson” became famous. Ms. Robinson is the name of a character in the film, and the Duo’s specific folk-rock sound is perfect fit for the movie. \r\n\r\nIn the end, although the two were close friends, the  pressure of pursuing music professionally split them apart. Paul Simon went on to pursue a solo career, which included recording an album in South Africa called “Graceland.” Art Garfunkel {+pursued-pursue|477} acting. The two speak from time to time.
