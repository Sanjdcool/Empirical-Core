Many members of the British government were furious. They made a decision to punish the people of Boston.<br /><br />Over the next few months, Parliament approved a series of new laws. The Boston Port Act declared that Boston Harbor would remain closed until the colonists paid for the tea that had been destroyed. No ships were allowed to enter or leave without British permission.<br /><br />The Massachusetts Government Act declared that the people of the colony were now under stricter control in terms of meetings and electing their own officials. From that point on, the British king and his ministers would make all decisions about which colonists would serve in important positions in Massachusetts.<br /><br />The Administration of Justice Act made new rules for trials. Bostonians accused of a crime would no longer be tried in Boston by fellow Bostonians. Instead, they would be sent either to another colony, such as Canada, or even to London. They would also be tried in a special Admiralty court by a judge handpicked by the king.<br /><br />The Quartering Act declared that the colonists had to provide quarters, or temporary places to live, for the British soldiers stationed in the colonies. The colonists also had to provide supplies such as food, bedding, candles, and firewood. This was significant because the British government was getting ready to send more soldiers to Boston.</p><br />"},"teach":{"script":[{"data":{"body":"<p><strong>Say:</strong> Read the passage on your screen.</p>","heading":"Instruct students to read the passage."},"type":"STEP-HTML"}],"title":"Core Knowledge Passage"}},"type":"CL-ST"},{"data":{"play":{"html":"<p>News of the Boston Tea Party reached Great Britain in 1774.</p><p>People were shocked.</p>","prompt":"<p>News of the Boston Tea Party reached Great Britain in 1774.</p><p>People were shocked.</p>"},"teach":{"script":[{"type":"T-MODEL"},{"data":{"body":"<p><em>Model for students how they can combine the sentences together.</em></p>","heading":"Model sentence combining."},"type":"STEP-HTML"}],"title":"Sentence Combining - Teacher Model"}},"type":"CL-MD"},{"data":{"play":{"prompt":"<p>News of the Boston Tea Party reached Great Britain in 1774.</p><p>People were shocked.</p>"},"teach":{"script":[{"data":{"body":"<p><strong>Say:</strong> Try combining the sentences on your own.</p>","heading":"Ask students to combine the sentences."},"type":"STEP-HTML"},{"type":"T-REVIEW"}],"title":"Sentence Combining - Student Response"}},"type":"CL-SA"},{"data":{"play":{"instructions":"Rewrite the sentence and complete the idea.","prefilledText":"Many members of the British government were furious, so","prompt":"<p>Many members of the British government were furious, so …</p>"},"teach":{"script":[{"data":{"body":"<p><strong>Say:</strong> Now try completing this sentence.</p>","heading":"Ask students to complete the sentence."},"type":"STEP-HTML"},{"type":"T-REVIEW"}],"title":"Sentence Stem - Student Response"}},"type":"CL-SA"},{"data":{"play":{"blankLabel":"answer","instructions":"<p>Answer “where?” in the first blank.</p><p>Answer “how?” in the second blank.</p>","nBlanks":2,"prompt":"They would be tried..."},"teach":{"script":[{"data":{"body":"<p><strong>Say:</strong> Now answer where they would be tried in the first blank, and how they would be tried in the second.</p>","heading":"Ask students to fill in the blanks."},"type":"STEP-HTML"},{"type":"T-REVIEW"}],"title":"Sentence Expansion - Student Response"}},"type":"CL-FL"},{"data":{"play":{"instructions":"Rewrite the sentence and complete the idea.","prefilledText":"They would be tried","prompt":"<p>They would be tried …</p>"},"teach":{"script":[{"data":{"body":"<p><strong>Say:</strong> Now try completing this sentence.</p>","heading":"Ask students to complete the sentence."},"type":"STEP-HTML"},{"type":"T-REVIEW"}],"title":"Sentence Expansion - Student Response"}},"type":"CL-SA"},{"data":{"play":{"html":"<p><strong>Review:</strong></p><br /><p>Today we learned about the American Revolution.

It developed along the Indus River on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The civilization was well-known for sophisticated cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro that included a grid street pattern and drainage systems. The Indus Civilization may have had a population of over five million. Over 2500 cities and settlements have been found. Around the middle of the second millennium B.C.E., the Indus River basin dried up, and the sites were abandoned.<br><br><strong>Vedic Civilization and Hinduism (1500 BCE- 320 BCE)</strong><br>After the fall of the Indus River Valley civilization, new settlements called the Vedic Civilization took root in India. Some scholars believe that the people who founded these civilizations migrated into India from the northwest. Several small kingdoms and tribes, which were often at war with each other, merged to form a few large ones.<br><br>The belief system that dominates India today, Hinduism, developed at this time.
