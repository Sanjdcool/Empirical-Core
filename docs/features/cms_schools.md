# CMS Schools Dashboard

## School Search

The school search is located at https://quill.org/cms/schools.

You can find schools that match a variety of criteria and then see a high-level overview of those schools.



### Gotchas

- The search query works with 'AND' logic. That means that if you search for 'School Name' and 'School City', you will only see schools that match BOTH the name and city.
- By default, schools with no teachers **will *not* display**. Please select "Include Schools with 0 Teachers" if you would like schools with no teachers to display in the results.

### Tips & Tricks

- You can select multiple premium statuses (or deselect them) by holding the CMD button on your computer while clicking.
- To see a list of teachers and admins in a school, or to edit its information, click the 'Edit' button on the leftmost column of the search results.
