              | is a nonprofit developer of free, interactive learning tools. Our mission is to make students active players in their education by presenting students with problems to solve and allowing them to construct solutions. In this environment students take charge of their own education.
            p We support students, teachers, and parents. Teachers can sign up their classes and monitor their students' progress. We are currently working on parental accounts so that parents can receive report cards on their students' progress.
            p We currently support middle school students studying English. We cover all of the grammatical concepts from the Common Core State Standards for grades 1-8. We intend to expand our coverage to high school students, college students, ESL students, SAT / ACT students, and foreign language students.
            p Reach out to us at #{mail_to 'hello@quill.org'}.
